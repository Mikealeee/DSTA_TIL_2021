# DSTA_TIL_2021
An AI competition held in the summer of 2021

The following repositry holds the challenges i attempted in the TIL 2021 competition held by DSTA. In this competition we were asked to make 1) object detection models and 2) LSTM models to perform audio classification. This competition was supposedly to be done as a team of 5. Unfortuately due to ____?____ reasons, i had to do this competiion as a solo effort. That being said, i still had an extremely fun filled and enjoyable time in this competition and would be looking forward in participating in it again. 

NNote: These models were done via the use of pytorch, not tensorflow. Incidentally this is the first time i used pytorch. Previously, I have always used tensorflow. I would say that i am stil more comfortable woth tensorflow still. 

OBJECT DETECTION (Challenges 1 and 3)
- In these challenges we were tasked to create a model that could classify 5(challenge 1) and 7(challenge 3) different animals. 

Audio classification (Challenges 2 and 4)
- In these challenges we were tasked to create a model that could classify 13(challenge 2) and 22(challenge 4) different words(speech patterns). 

I obtained 28th position out of thr 63 teams that were participating in the UT cateogry. 
I would say im fairly content with how I faired in this competition. Though I would of course have liked to score better, I felt i did the best I could (especially as a one man team). All in all, I picked up a couplle of additional skills and insights through this competition and would be sure to perform even better in the future!

NOTE: Unfortunately, I think im not allowed to share the source code(70% sure). As such I would  just be releasing the models that i have trained.
